## Moderncv

Fork of the LaTeX moderncv package to support new features (font-awesome icons, github profile)

### Installation

This new package depends on `fontawesome.sty` (see https://gist.github.com/kuhess/5205073).

You can install the package in your local LaTeX package tree.

On Mac, copy all the files to `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/moderncv`

### Usage

To use the package, with the new features:
```LaTeX
\usepackage{moderncv}
\moderncvstyle{classic}
```

Now, you can use a new command in your moderncv classic:
```LaTeX
\github{kuhess}
```

You can also use Font-Awesome symbols:
```LaTeX
\iconMobilePhone{}
```

Finally, you can compile with:
```bash
xelatex resume.tex
```


### Original README
moderncv -- a modern curriculum vitae class

Moderncv provides a documentclass for typesetting modern curriculum vitaes in
various styles. It is fairly customizable, allowing you to define your own style
by changing the colors, the fonts, ... and provides two default styles: classic
and casual.

The moderncv documentclass need it's input to be formatted with regular
commands like:
  \section,
  \subsection,
  \maketitle,
but also defines its own special commands:
  \cventry,
  \firstname,
  \familyname,
  ...
Most commands are defined in such a way that the arguments are optional.

Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.

Until a decent manual is written, you can always look in the "examples"
directory for some examples.
